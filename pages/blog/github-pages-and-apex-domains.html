<h1>GitHub Pages with a custom root domain loses you 35% of your visitors</h1>

<p class="warning">Update: <strong>This is no longer true</strong> since at least August 2014. GitHub fixed this!

<p>If you have a website on GitHub Pages that sits on a root domain (a domain that isn’t a subdomain), you’re in trouble.

<p>Have you ever noticed how your site loads slowly sometimes? It’s not your connection.

<h2>Some scary stats</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages with a custom domain is <b><em>unbelievably slow</em></b>.

<p><img src="/images/scary-analytics.png" title="Average page load time: 3.49 seconds">

<p>Visitors to this site’s index page have an average page load time of 3.5 seconds. 70% of those are here for the first time. 3.5 ÷ 70% = 5. So first time visitors have an average page load time of <b>5 seconds</b>. <sup id="note-analytics-back"><a href="#note-analytics">1</a></sup>

<p>This website is now off of GitHub Pages and loads in 700 milliseconds on a first visit, gaining over 4 seconds.

<p>What do you lose when you add 4 seconds of delay on a first time visit?

<p>Of the visitors that visit your GitHub Pages site for the first time, 35% more of them won’t bother to open another page. Your bounce rate is doubled.

<h2>Where does this problem come from?</h2>

<p>Anselm Hannemann has <a href="http://helloanselm.com/2014/github-pages-redirect-performance/" title="Analyzing the GitHub Pages Waterfall Chart">a good rundown of the problem</a>, including a note from GitHub support. When a domain has a DNS A record (pointing to GitHub Pages’ IP), GitHub’s DDoS mitigation technology has no alternative than to make a long redirect

<p>What I’ve noticed is that sometimes it’s not just a big long redirect but multiple 302 redirects. This behavior isn’t documented anywhere it seems.

<p><a href="/images/302-spam.png" data-no-instant><img src="/images/302-spam.png" style="width: 100%" title="Multiple 302 redirects"></a>

<p>5 seconds seems big. When I notice a slow GitHub Pages website the wait seems to be more around 3 seconds, and that’s what I usually see in Chrome’s Network panel. The thing is, InstantClick’s visitors are spread around the world, my guess is this is what tilt the balance. <sup id="note-cosmopolitan-back"><a href="#note-cosmopolitan">2</a></sup>



<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>The short solution is, instead of using <code>yourdomain.com</code>, use <code>www.yourdomain.com</code>. <sup id="note-cname-back"><a href="#note-cname">3</a></sup>

<p>If you want to keep your clean www-less domain, you’ll have to move off of GitHub Pages, and/or use CloudFlare who can have a <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cname-flattening-rfc-compliant-cnames-at-a-domains-root">CNAME record on the root domain</a>. The latter has the advantage of making your website super-fast across the globe with its edge caching feature.

<p><em>Updates: 1. Thanks to Hacker News’s dknecht who <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7738362">pointed out</a> that CloudFlare can have a CNAME record on the root domain, which should solve GitHub Pages’ performance issues. 2. I previously recommended moving to Neocities, but <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7738781">they currently have similar problems</a>. :(</em>

<p>This website uses a Digital Ocean VPS <sup id="note-digitalocean-back"><a href="#note-digitalocean">4</a></sup> with CloudFlare.

<p>By the way, you should defitively <a href="/">check out InstantClick</a> if you care about web performance.

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

<ol id="footnotes">
  <li id="note-analytics">I couldn’t find a way to get this number from Google Analytics directly. The difference with subsequent page load times isn’t counted here, because with InstantClick (<a href="/">check it out</a>) subsequent page loads usually take zero second. <a href="#note-analytics-back" class="noteBack">↩</a>
  <li id="note-cosmopolitan">The 5 top-visiting countries are USA (22%), France (9%), Russia (7%), China (6%) and UK (6%). I’m personally located in France. <a href="#note-cosmopolitan-back" class="noteBack">↩</a>
  <li id="note-cname">Update: I previously recommended putting a CNAME from the root domain to the www domain here. But as <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7738424">pointed out</a> by pilif on Hacker News that’s not possible (unless you use CloudFlare). It’s what’s causing the issue with GitHub Pages in the first place actually, <em>duh</em>. <a href="#note-cname-back" class="noteBack">↩</a>
